## Description

In order to simulate a model for a temperature control system 
of a chemical tank, a basic version was made in Python using a 
natural decay in temperature and a system that heats the target 
if it falls below a lower bound. The simulation is currently split 
into three main parts: \
* temperature_control.py - Holds the basic variables and functions 
related to the chemical tank
* tc_controller.py - Holds functions for starting and stopping the
simulation
* main.py - The driver file which starts and stops the simulation
while printing information to the console
